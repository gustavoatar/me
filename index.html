				<div class="info yellow">
					<p>The magic drape dress</p>
					<p>Both Helmut Lang and T by Alexander Wang have become go-to labels for jersey fanatics &ndash; simply because their drapey, but fashion forward designs are universally flattering. Our pick of the new season is this Helmut Lang Composite dress. The darker bottom inevitably draws attention to the lighter coloured top, which is draped down the body to elongate even the most vertically challenged silhouette.</p>

					<p>the leg-lengthening heel</p>
					<p>This season's slow&ndash;burning winner is the D'Orsay heel(a shoe with cutaway sides). It works its magic by revealing the arch of your foot &ndash; a highly flattering tactic. Making your feet and ankles appear more finely turned, the D'Orsay also has the knock&ndash;on effect of elongated legs. </p>

				<div class="info fl">
					<p>the silk </br> shirt</p>
					<p>We picked this super&ndash;soft silk shirt over the rest because of its body&ndash;skimming fabric and asymmetric rear hem, which flatters even the most generous derrière. If that wasn&#39;t enough, the concealed&ndash;button front  offers a streamlined effect, while the narrow collar sits flat to your neck, framing the face in a girlish, gamine way. What&#39;s not to love?

					<p>The booty-booster dress</p>
					<p>If you hide your body in a tent of fabric, you&#39;ll only emphasise your size. While a body&ndash;con dress may be the curvy girl&#39;s bête noire, the truth is you actually need some booty to make the style work. With sheer panels at the sides &ndash; both to reveal and conceal &ndash; this French Connection frock maximises sex appeal and keeps you decent!</p>

					<p>While boyfriend&ndash;style shirts are definitely cool, for the most&ndash;becoming shape the slim&ndash;cut chemise wins every time. This bold patterned blouse by MSGM flatters at every turn. Three&ndash;quarter sleeves flash your wrists, while the defined waist nips you in, in all the right places.</p>

					<p>The booty-booster dress</p>
					<p>While skinnies have ruled in recent years, there&#39;s no denying that a gentle flare is the most flattering option. Balancing bigger bottoms, these Marrakesh jeans are MiH&#39;s best&ndash;seller, simply because they streamline your pins. Known as the 'legs eleven' jeans because they make your legs go on forever, there&#39;s a space in every wardrobe for these bad boys.</p>
